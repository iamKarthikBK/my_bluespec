# Learning BSV

## Lecture 1

- 17:15 -> Why does the start method have 'Action' but not the result method?
- 51:13 -> BSV preserves module hierarchy very well, by treating the smallest of elements (including registers) as modules.
- 51:13 -> SystemC and other high level HDL don't allow us to make use of all kinds of abstraction and parameterization when we are trying to write synthesizable code. Bluespec allows us to do everything, while still retaiing the 'synthesizability'.
